Dense Neural Network classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset

Investigated various weight initialization strategies, drop-out, normalization techniques and learning rate schedulers on a fully connected neural network model.

Framework used - Keras

Achieved an test accuracy of 54.51% for the best hperparameter configuration.


Notebooks are named according to the case-id in results.md within the folder 'Cases'

Based on the exercise from “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow", 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly)

Future Scope:

Recompiling the notebooks into modular python function files

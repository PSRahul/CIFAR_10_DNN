# CIFAR_10_DNN
Dense Neural Network classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset

Trained 20 hidden layer Dense Neural Network for the CIFAR10 dataset.

Investigated various activation function , initialisers ,dropout techniques such as Mac Dropout and learning schedules and batch Normalisation,Early stopping.

Frameworks used - Tensorflow,Keras
Achieved an test accuracy of 54.51% for the best configuration.


Based on the exercise from “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow", 2nd Edition, by Aurélien Géron (O’Reilly)
